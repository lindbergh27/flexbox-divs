            <p>##A good day is a day on the water. Once I woke up on a clear morning on a lake. I was on my boat the Seeker tied to the shore. My little girls were asleep below. I jumped onto shore and untied the lines that had held us there overnight. Then
                I pushed the boat out into the water. There was the lightest breeze blowing, but it was just enough to carry us along the shore to the marina a half mile down. I waived to a fisherman I silently passed along the way. It was all so golden.</p>

            <p>This morning I cut up a piece of an older trailer pulling device. I harvested to large cable tightening devices from it. Then I put the left over steel into the recyling bin.</p>
